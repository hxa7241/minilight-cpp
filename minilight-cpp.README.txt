Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. See the main MiniLight
readme for a general description.




Installation
------------

### Requirements ###

* MacOS 10.5, or Windows 2000/XP, or GNU/Linux 2009ish, or later


### Guide ###

Simply copy the minilight-cpp executable file to wherever.

The program reads the model file given and creates and writes the image file
requested; nothing else is touched.




Building
--------

It is an ordinary simple build. There are no special requirements or
dependencies: Everything needed is in the supplied archive (assuming the build
environment and tools are already prepared).

However, LLVM-Clang invocation might vary so the build script might need
adjusting.

Choose a build script:
* Mac:   make/build-mac.sh (for LLVM-GCC 4.2 or GCC 4)
* Linux: make/build-linux.sh (for LLVM-GCC 4.2 or GCC 4)

Run scripts from the 'cpp' directory.

Appendix:
The code uses double-precision FP and is for 64-bit builds. Changing either the
FP use to single-precision or the build to 32-bit probably means it would be
best to change the other too.
